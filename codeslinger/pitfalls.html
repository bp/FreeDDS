  <h3>Trying too hard</h3>
    DDS can be awkward. Especially when using
    older, distributed applications as templates. Many older programs were
    written before the advent of the convenience routines and therefore use
    the more flexible, but mind-numbing, double buffering technique. This
    always obscures the intended purpose of the application.<br><br>

    When practical, start with templates in the
    <a href="basiccodes.html"><b>Basic Example Codes</b></a>
    area.

<br><br>
  <h3>Bad format strings passed to fdds_scanf and fdds_printf</h3>
    The <b>'fmt'</b> arguments used for the <b>fdds_scanf</b>,
    <b>fdds_printf</b>, <b>fdds_prtcon</b> and friends <b>MUST</b> use the
    NULL terminator <b>'\0'</b>. Fortran-to-C character string hand-offs
    are notoriously troublesome. The NULL terminator is a stable solution
    to this problem.

<br><br>
  <h3>Too few arguments in varargs area of *dds_printf</h3>
    The number of arguments converted by the <b>*dds_printf</b>,
    <b>*dds_prtcon</b>, <b>*dds_prtmsg</b>, and <b>*dds_prterr</b> functions
    will exactly match the format conversion requests in the <b>'fmt'</b>
    argument. If you pass fewer variables than the conversion requests,
    the program will nearly always die.

<br><br>
  <h3>Scanning for parameters from the wrong dictionary</h3>
    It's easy to forget which dictionary is in <b>'scan'</b> mode. 
    Remember that after opening an input dataset, the input dictionary 
    is set for scanning and when opening an output dataset, the output
    dictionary is set for printing.  However, when interleaving scans of 
    data dictionaries with scans of the <b>par:</b> dictionary, it may save 
    headaches to precede each block of scans with <b>*dds_dict</b> or 
    <b>*ddx_dict</b>, as appropriate.

<br><br>
  <h3>Wrong file permissions for input</h3>
    Ocasionally, failure to have write permissions to a file has been known
    to cause read failures. This is known to happen when copying read-only
    data from a DVD to a hard disk. (A fix to this was reported May, 2009)
