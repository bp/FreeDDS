    In its most basic form, a dictionary is a text file that describes data.
    That file contains a series of definitions. Nothing more. Common definitions
    include the names of data axes, the size of each axis, sample increments and
    origins, and data units. More detailed definitions describing trace formats
    and sample types may also be present.

    <p>
    Dictionaries are also used for parfiles and command line parameters.

    <p>
    Although DDS formally uses 20 or more predefined dictionaries, Only 3 stand
    out for their frequency of use and the need for both users and developers to
    understand them.

    <ul>
      <li><b>Data Dictionaries</b> - Typically a
        <b><a href="dictionaries/text.html">text file dictionary</a></b> is 
        associated with each dataset. It defines characteristics of the binary
        data.  For some predefined formats (e.g. segy) DDS uses the line header
        as a <b><a href="dictionaries/binary.html">binary dictionary</a></b>.
        A complete dictionary is created by combining binary line header
        information with the predefined segy format.
        <br><br></li>

      <li><b>Command Line Dictionaries</b> - Input/output filenames and other 
        command line parameters used by an application are stored in the 
        <b><a href="dictionaries/cmdln.html">cmd: dictionary</a></b>.<br><br></li>

      <li><b>Parfile Dictionaries</b> - Parfiles contain additional parameters 
        that are either too long or too difficult to put on the command line.  
        They are an extension of the command line. Parameter definitions are put 
        into a file and that file is specified on the command line as 
        <code><b>par=</b><i>file</i></code>.  These definitions are stored by DDS 
        in the <b><a href="dictionaries/parfile.html">par: dictionary</a></b>. </li>
    </ul>
