            Joe Dellinger: DDS, A Seismic Processing Architecture
          </u></b><br/>
        The Data Dictionary System (DDS1) is a seismic processing 
        architecture. It has proved its value for both research and 
        production in seismic imaging inside Amoco and BP for more than
        a decade. The software has been ported to more than a dozen 
        hardware platforms and the data sets can be efficiently accessed
        across any combination of them. A key (and at this time, unique) 
        feature of DDS is its ability to read and write almost any data
        format. This is primarily useful because it allows DDS to
        inter-operate with other processing systems, allowing DDS to 
        serve as a bridge between different processing environments. 
        However, in the spirit of reproducible research, it also allows 
        DDS to document data so that it can be read and understood into
        the future. DDS was released by BP America in 2003 under an
        open-source license. The goal of this paper is to reveal useful
        innovations so that subsequent projects can benefit from DDS,
        as DDS has benefited from concepts from earlier processing
        systems. <br/><br/>


      <li><b><u>
            Randy Selzler: PSEIS, A Processing Architecture Blueprint 
          </u></b><br/>
        The Parallel Seismic Earth Imaging System (PSEIS1) is a software
        package that is envisioned as a successor to DDS2. It will retain
        the high efficiency that made DDS suitable for production 
        processing at a leading HPC facility. Its flexibility will continue
        to facilitate advanced research in seismic processing and imaging.
        It will also continue to inter-operate with other processing
        system in order to maximize total value. The new system provides
        an alternative to MPI for parallel processing on 
        distributed-memory machines. By tailoring it specifically for
        seismic processing, applications will be easier to develop,
        maintain and execute, while remaining efficient and scalable.
        This scheme is described in a companion paper session �PSEIS,
        Blueprint for Parallel Processing.� The system supports parallel 
        I/O by slicing data set dimensions across independent file systems.
        I/O can split headers and samples into separate file for special
        processing. Two user interfaces are provided that complement 
        each other. Power users can leverage existing skills with scripts
        and casual users can benefit from the GUI. Object-Oriented 
        technology is used to improve robustness, functionality and long
        term cost. <br/><br/>

      <li><b><u>
            Randy Selzler: PSEIS, A Blueprint for Parallel Processing
          </u></b><br/>
        The Parallel Seismic Earth Imaging System (PSEIS1) is a software
        package that is envisioned as a successor to DDS2. It provides
        an alternative to MPI for parallel programming on distributed 
        (and shared) memory machines. The objective is to make it easier
        to develop, maintain and execute parallel applications that are
        efficient and scalable. This is accomplished by integrating the
        technology into the I/O architecture and by tailoring it
        specifically to seismic processing. The new scheme provides
        a strategy for fault-tolerant processing, check-point restarts,
        persistent data storage, out-of-core solvers, data monitoring
        and parallel debugging.<br/><br/>

      <li><b><u>
            Joe Dellinger: Vplot graphics language - past, present, and
            future
          </u></b><br/>
        Vplot is the graphical language used by the Stanford Exploration
        Project's "SEPlib" seismic processing system. Application programs
        such as "Graph", "Wiggle", and "Grey" write out specifications for
        plots in "vplot format". The appropriate vplot "pen" filter then
        reads in the vplot file and produces the desired plot on the 
        corresponding graphical device.<br/><br/> 

        Vplot was originally created to allow consistent plotting on any
        of a dozen or so different graphical devices, each of which could
        only be accessed using its own unique and proprietary programming
        interface. With so many devices (and now ones arriving every few
        months!), writing a separate version of each plotting program for
        each device would have been completely impractical. Today, 
        however, that is exactly what we do: most graphical programs 
        directly support "X", "postscript", and/or "bitmaps". <br/><br/>

        Vplot is still in use today at least partly because the challenge
        of supporting so many different incompatible devices imposed a 
        discipline that produced a flexible and powerful internal 
        programming logic. Even with the universe of plotting devices now
        collapsed down to only 3, vplot has been useful enough in making
        those 3 compatible to survive. 

        In my talk I will explain the "vplot virtual device" and show how
        it was meant to be used. I will show what I think are the "good
        ideas" vplot contains that even today have not been replicated
        in other systems. Foremost among these is the "4th canonical
        graphical device", the "capture the changes I've made and turn
        that back into a new figure" device ("vppen"). I will also show
        useful features in vplot that should still be used, but have
        been forgotten. <br/><br/>

        Finally, I will discuss "where should we go from here". If we wish
        to use vplot with Madagascar, now is our chance to update it! 
        <br/><br/>
