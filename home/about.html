      </script> is currently President of 
      <a href="http://data-warp.com">Data-Warp, Inc</a>. It was founded in
      1999 and provides consulting services for seismic imaging software 
      on High-Performance Computers (HPC). Randy has a BSEE from SDSU. 
      He worked for Amoco at the Tulsa Research Center in the Geophysical
      Research Department for 24 years. This provided valuable exposure
      to bleeding edge geophysics, seismic processing and the people that
      make it happen. Randy's primary interests include advanced 
      processing architectures, High-Performance Computing and seismic
      imaging applications. He designed and implemented the Data 
      Dictionary System (DDS) in 1995 for Amoco. In 2004 Randy founded 
      the PSEIS Consortium to <i>"Develop and support a world class
        seismic processing platform that is suitable for production 
        processing and R&amp;D activities"</i>.<br clear="left"/><br/>

      </script> has a PhD in Nuclear Physics from UCLA.  He has worked for
      Amoco at the Tulsa Research Center since 1979 and now for BP since 1999.
      Jerry worked with Randy in some of the early years of development on
      DDS and at the time of the <b>BP</b> merger took over the support 
      efforts of DDS. At that time the Crays were dropped and the Disco 
      format was no longer used.  But the later merger with <b>ARCO</b> 
      helped make the transition to Linux clusters more effectively 
      from the older Thinking Machines' CM5's. In 2003 FreeDDS was released 
      by BP under an open-source license through the 
      <a href="http://www.freeusp.org">FreeUSP</a> website (thanks to Paul 
      Garossino and their 
      <a href="http://www.freeusp.org/FreeUSP_License.html">FreeUSP License</a>). 
      It includes a small collection of seismic imaging programs and 
      associated utilities written at the Houston
      Exploration and Technology Group within BP America Inc. This is
      being offered in the hopes that it may foster education,
      understanding and collaboration amongst the world wide seismic
      imaging community.  DDS continues to provide the software
      infrastructure for advanced seismic imaging at one of the world's
      largest geophysical HPC centers

      Joe started supporting DDS in preparation for Jerry's retirement in
      early 2012.
