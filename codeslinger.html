    <center><h1>Learning to code with DDS</h1></center>

    <p>
    DDS has a full featured API for handling multidimensional seismic data
    in a variety of data formats. Tools for manipulating data only,
    data+headers, user parameters, dictionaries, and print files lead to an
    extensive (and often confusing) list of DDS functions. This Code Slinger
    area attempts to guide developers to the most important DDS functions
    first. The goal is to achieve a respectable level of DDS capability,
    allowing you to use DDS to implement geophysical applications for many
    common problems.

    <p>
    From the most distant functional view, DDS does two things:
    <br><li>Manages binary streams of data
    <br><li>Manages information about those data
    <br>

    <p><p> <!-- 2 'new paragraphs' to help Konqueror format this correctly -->
    When developing applications, it is useful to put the relative importance
    of the DDS API in perspective. The "distant functional view" is useful
    because it downplays the importance of DDS in geophysical algorithms.

    <p>
    DDS knows very little about geophysics.
    Algorithms, geophysical methods, and computational methods are the
    responsibility of application developers.

    <p>
    What DDS does best is provide data and information about those data to
    the application. In addition to this, DDS gives users control over program
    function, provides feedback on how the program sees data and user
    parameters, and writes results in one of many formats understood by DDS
    and other tools.
