    <p>
      DDS is designed around Dictionaries which contain Definitions
      comprised of "name" and "value" pairs. Definitions may come from the
      command line, a parameter file (defined by "par=..." on the command
      line), or input Data Dictionaries. Application programs are
      controlled by Definitions and binary data are defined by them.

    <p>
      Control Definitions fall into three categories: input, output, and 
      algorithm control. Algorithm control is specific to each application
      and associated Definitions should be documented with each.  Some
      conventions are recommended, but are not mandatory; some DDS
      applications may deviate from them to achieve their objectives.
      Definitions that control input and output are common to most DDS
      applications and are described in these web pages.

    <p>
      These control Definitions are kept in an internal Dictionary named 
      "<code>par:</code>".  Each processing step has its own, independent
      "<code>par:</code>" Dictionary which contains definitions from the 
      command line and parameter file.  These definitions are thus "local
      parameters" that only effect the current application execution.  
      "Global parameters" are Definitions maintained in the Data
      Dictionaries.

    <p>
      Only definitions that are potentially meaningful to both end users
      and programmers are included here.  Definitions that are only
      relevant to "C" or Fortran programmers are described in
      <a href="developers.html">Developers Section</a>.
