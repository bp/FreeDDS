These are some standard fft wrappers to various FFT routines
calling various system-dependent fft routines.  It's easier
to change it here for new routines and/or new systems than
in each program.

These include multiple 1D, 2D & 3D fft's.  Initialization takes
place in each routine along with any needed working arrays each
time it's call.  The reasoning is that the overhead should be
small in comparison to the fft's themselves.  That way these
routines are also thread-safe.

For now I am only providing fortran interfaces for these
few routines.

The fft_xxx_i8.F version are created as another level for the
mkl routines so interface to the I8 interface to allow for
more than 2 Giga words:

   - IA32 uses LP64 model (i.e. 4-byte integer)
   - IA64 and X86_64 uses ILP64 model (i.e. 8 byte integer).

Build include mkl_dfti with:

   ifort -c [-i8] /hpc/intel/mkl/9.1/include/mkl_dfti.f90
