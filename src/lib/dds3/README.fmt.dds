   assorted notes on lex and yacc compiler

   "C" assignment operator must be escaped
      count \= 5;
   Support for "void" type (not just pointers to void).
      void SEGY_GREEN_PREFIX;
   Array dimensions may be zero, to eliminate storage
      byte1 segy_binary_pad[SEGY_BINARY_PAD];
         within structure, member alignment is honored
   Structures and unions may be empty.
      Artifact of "-:" field operator.
   Built-in functions 
      ident("funky-name")
         accept special characters in names (i.e. "SHOT-X")
      defn_value("dict", "defn")
         like "#include", but accectable as a unary expression
            float4 Samples[defn_value("hist:", "size.axis(1)")]
      defn_array("dict", "defn", type_name)
         like an array of constants
            ... = defn_array("hist:", "grid.offset", float)[n];
   Built-in dictionaries recognized by "defn_value", "defn_array",
      #include and #declare
      par:
         local dictionary
      hist:
         global dictionary (current binary)
      usp:
         "usp_fmt.dds" dictionary
      segy:
