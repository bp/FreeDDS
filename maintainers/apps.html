      This provides a more detailed set of instructions for maintaining the 
      DDS applications.  For quick, simple installation procedure on
      a single platform, go to <a href='../download/apps.html'>Quick
      Applications Installation</a>.
     
    <p>
      HOW TO INSTALL THE DDS APPLICATIONS FROM SOURCE CODE:

    <p>DDS applications can be obtained by 1) downloading,
      untarring, making and installing applications; or 2)
      creating your own applications using DDS library calls
      and linking into the libraries.  You can use the make 
      structure, MakeVariables and MakeRules, provided in the
      etc directory. The other make files are for building the
      dds libraries.
    <ol>
      <li>
        Before building any DDS applications, the DDS libraries must
        first be in place (see <a href="lib.html">Library Installation</a>).
        These libraries include:
        <ul>
          <li><b>libdds_r3.a</b> - core DDS API routines
          <li><b>libchost.a</b>  - host dependent routines for "C"
            programs
          <li><b>libfhost.a</b>  - host dependent routines for
            Fortran programs
          <li><b>libgio.a</b>    - generalized buffered I/O routines
            for DDS
          <li><b>libfft.a</b>    - basic fft wrappers for different
            platforms
          <li><b>libfftw.a</b>   - fftw routines from fftw.org used
            by the fft wrappers on platforms that do not have good fft's
          <li><b>librfftw.a</b>  - rfftw routines from fftw.org used 
            by the fft wrappers
        </ul>
        <p>
          These libraries can be installed by downloading the DDS source,
          making and installing the libraries. For platforms that are not
          already setup for the DDS make structure, you can modify the 
          make structure (see <a href="lib/config.html">Makefile Configuration</a>)
          then build and install the libraries. That can be a challenge.<br />
        <p>
          For each application enter
          "make" to build an  application; "make update" to build
          and update the binary to the distribution directory; "make
          install" to update and also install the bin startup script
          and the man page; or "make all" to make use of the
          REMOTE_HOSTS to build and install on multiple platforms.
          Use "make help", "make variables" and/or "make flags"
          for more information on the application make structure 
          which is totally different form the dds libarary make scheme.
      <li>For the MPI codes, make sure an executable copy of "mpirun"
        is in the correct path (${DDS_DIST}/*/*/mbs/prod/*) for
        your system. Also modify MakeVariables in
        ${DDSROOT}/src/lib/host so that the CCFlags, FCFlags,
        LibDirs &amp; Libes have the correct info for building MPI
        on your platform.<br><br>
      <li>Execute the script called "MakeApps" which will make and
        install all applications.  for the current platform 
        (or you can go into each of the src/cmd subdirectories
        and run "make" and "make install").<br><br>
      <li>After building the applications, add "${DDS_DIST}/bin" 
        into your PATH environment variable and run "rehash". 
        That should allow you to be able to run any of the 
        built applications.  Each application has a startup 
        script in "${DDS_DIST}/bin which will setup and execute
        the corresponding binary associated with the current 
        platform.  This way  executables from multiple platforms 
        can coexist together under ${DDS_DIST}.  Run any 
        application with "-h" or "help=" on the command line
        to display the online help for that application. 
        You can also add "${DDS_DIST}/man/mbs" to your MANPATH 
        environment variable to get to the application man pages.
    </ol>
