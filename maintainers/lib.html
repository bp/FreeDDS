    <p>
      This provides a more detailed set of instructions for maintaining the 
      DDS libraries.  For quick, simple installation procedure on
      a single platform, go to <a href='../download/lib.html'>Quick Library
      Installation</a>.
          
    <ol>
      <li>Execute "<code>make</code>" (or "<code>make</code>")
        from this root DDS directory to build AND 
        install "fhost", "chost", "gio", "dds_r3", "fftw" and
        "fft" libraries for the local machine.  (You can alternately 
        go into each of the src/lib directories, run "make" and "make
        install"; just make sure you run a "make install" in the host
        directory first.)<br><br>

      <li>If you have downloaded and untarred the documentation under
        the dds root, then either point your local brouser to 
        "<code><var>${DDSROOT}</var>/doc/html/index.html</code>"
        or make sure the "html" directory is under a subdirectory of the
        web server directory. "PHP" will need to be operational for
	the searching engine and man pages displaying.<br><br>

      <li>After these libraries (and accompanied information) are 
        inplace, then look at the <a href="apps.html">Applications Installation</a>
        for building the DDS applications.  You should now have the following DDS 
        libararies installed under ${DDSROOT}/lib/&lt;ARCHDIRS&gt;:
        <ul>
          <li><b>libdds_r3.a</b> - core DDS API routines
          <li><b>libchost.a</b>  - host dependent routines for 'c'
            programs
          <li><b>libfhost.a</b>  - host dependent routines for
            Fortran programs
          <li><b>libgio.a</b>    - generalized buffered I/O routines
            for DDS
          <li><b>libfft.a</b>    - basic fft wrappers for different
            platforms
          <li><b>libfftw.a</b>   - fftw routines from fftw.org used
            by fft wrappers
            on platforms that do not have good fft's in place.
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You probably will need to download the DDS documentation 
      (or go to the DDS website) for both the use of DDS as well as 
      the API calls for application developers.

The makefiles automatically creates directories.
This includes the TARCH directory and directories on remote hosts.

Example make targets...

   make                       # default target and default host.

   make openbin.o             # specific target (default host).

   make target=openbin.o      # ...same thing.

   make source                # make indirect source files.
                              #    This creates some ".c" and ".h"
                              #    files from other source files.
                              #    This may only work from "sun4".

   make gssgi1                # make specific host (default targets).
                              #    see sun4/gssgi1.LOG for status.
                              #    Only works from a "sun4" host

                              #    at the "apr" site.

   make host=gssgi1           # ...same thing.

   make host=gssgi1 openbin.o # make specific host and target.

   make remotes               # make remote hosts, but not local.
                              #    see sun4/*.LOG for status.

   make all                   # make remote and local hosts.
   make host=all              # make remote and local hosts.

   make install               # install on local hosts.
   make allinstall            # install remote and local hosts.
   make host=all install      # install remote and local hosts.

   make clean                 # remove $TARCH/*.o and lib*.a etc.

   make host=all clean        # cleanup all hosts
