    <p>
      DDS_HEAP is used to validate dds malloc and free usage.  Validation is
      turned on by defining DDS_HEAP_CHECK, and recompiling DDS malloc.c,
      calloc.c, and realloc.c. All blocks are validated whenever the heap is
      changed.  Currently, this is turned on in the "dds_config.h" header file.
    </p>
         
    <p>                                                   
      The size of each "user" buffer is increased to allow for these checks.
      Three copies of DDS_HEAP exist for each active block.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>immediately before the "user" buffer.</li>
      <li> immediately after  the "user" buffer.</li>
      <li>within the dds_heap "stack"</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      (1) and (2) are used to detect "user" buffer overruns. If the block is 
      freed, (1) and (2) are discarded and the "size" of (3) is reset to zero.</p>

    <pre>
    DDS_HEAP_CREEP  - The number of bytes needed for one    
    DDS_HEAP struct - Rounded up to nominal alignment.
