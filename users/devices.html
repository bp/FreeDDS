    <p>
      DDS has built-in capabilities to handle physical devices  (tape and 
      disk drives) directly.  There are special Device Attributes associated
      with these devices.  For example, tape drives have labels, density,
      lengths, and block sizes. Attributes supported by DDS are described.
      The end user is normally concerned with only a few keyword attributes.
      They are label, dsn, merge, online, and offline.

    <p>
      Device attributes are controlled by device Definitions. The device
      name itself is used in place of an input or output filename.  Then
      a Definition with the name of that device is used to specify the
      device attributes.  This following example assumes multiple reels of
      tape are input. Traces from all reels are concatenated together.
      If a reel has multiple files, they are merged.

    <pre>
in_data= /dev/rst0b
/dev/rst0b= merge label "RE2201 RE2202 RE2203"
    </pre>
