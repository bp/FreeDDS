    <p>
      Messages are printed to standard error, when problems are detected
      (normally standard is rerouted to the DDS print file).  Nominal
      processing can also be monitored.  The contents of each trace read
      or written can be printed. The real names of temporary files can be
      printed, and their contents preserved for inspection.

    <p>
      The end user can define 

<pre>dds_debug= <var>keywords</var></pre>

    <p>
      to control this feature. Recognized values are shown below.
      Keyword groups are mutually exclusive. The keyword read (or write)
      may be added to limit the dump to input (or output) traces.

    <pre>
keyword            description
----------------   --------------------------------------
diff               only field changes
diff0              lower level changes
diff1              same as "diff"
diff2              secondary sort changes
max                set diff dump limit (default 30)
list "f1 f2 ..."   dump selected headers
usp                dump set subset of usp headers
segy               dump set subset of segy headers
-verbose           turn off verbose mode (on by default)
-debug             turn off debug print (on by default)
+tmp               save tmp files (off by default)
read               dump on read only
write              dump on write only
seek               dump on seek only
dbg_heap           check memory on each allocation &amp; free
dbg_alloc          check memory on each allocation
dbg_free           check memory on each free
dbg_call           check memory on each API call
dbg_trace          trace all API calls
dbg_scanner        trace compiler scanner
dbg_uncompile      dump uncompile stacks
dbg_symbol         dump binary symbol tables
dbg_binary         dump binary
dbg_panic          dump binary tables on panic
dbg_all            dump all
    </pre>

    <p>
      If "<code>dds_debug= buf 8</code>" is defined, all fields in all
      traces are printed. Vector field dumps are limited to 8 elements.
      This prints a lot of (unwanted) information.

    <p>
      If "<code>dds_debug= read diff</code>" is defined, only input
      traces are printed. By default, vector field dumps are limited to 30
      elements. The name and value of all fields in the first trace are
      printed. After the first, fields are printed only if they differ 
      from the previous trace. This makes interesting information more
      visible, by eliminating clutter from constant fields. The end user
      can replace uncertainty with knowledge, when faced with new data.

    <p>
      <u>Hint</u>: If only the dump is wanted, define 
      "<code>out_data= /dev/null</code>" to dispose of binary data.

    <p>
      If the <code><u>read</u></code> keyword is eliminated, both input and 
      output traces are printed. This can be used to quality control
      field mapping from one format to another. An input trace is
      displayed, followed by the corresponding output trace. Some 
      applications may dump traces by ensemble (records, or 2D planes).

    <p>
      If <code><u>diff2</u></code> is used, more clutter is eliminated.
      Traces are compared to two previous values. Constant fields are
      printed, only if they start changing. Varying fields are printed,
      only if they become constant. This technique highlights field 
      changes at secondary sort (record) boundaries. All fields are
      printed from the first two traces, to provide a reference point.
      
    <p>
      The <code><u>list</u></code> keyword is used to select fields for
      a tabular dump. Selected fields are printed on one line for each
      trace. Only the first value from a vector field is displayed.
      The keywords, <code><u>usp</u></code> and <code><u>segy</u></code>,
      are predefined lists. If multiple standards are requested,
      a compromise is made to limit print line width. For example:

    <pre>
dds_debug= usp

comment= "usp", as an explicit list
dds_debug= list "RecNum TrcNum RecInd DphInd
    SrcLoc SoPtNm SrcPnt LinInd DstSgn StaCor"
    </pre>

    <p>
      Standard error will scroll off the screen, unless redirected.
      Redirection syntax is dependent upon the Unix shell. These examples
      assume the C shell is used to execute bridge.

    <pre>
bridge par= <var>file</var> &gt;&amp; log

bridge par= <var>file</var> |&amp; more

bridge par= <var>file</var> |&amp; xcat

bridge par= <var>file</var> |&amp; tee log

(bridge par= <var>file</var> | <var>cmd2</var> ...) |&amp; tee log
    </pre>

    <p>
      <u>Hint</u>: <i>ctrl-c</i> can be used to interrupt execution,
      after sufficient data is printed.

    <p>
      These examples assume the Bourne shell is used.

    <pre>
bridge par= <var>file</var> 2&gt; log

bridge par= <var>file</var> 2&gt;&amp;1 | more

bridge par= <var>file</var> 2&gt;&amp;1 | xcat

bridge par= <var>file</var> 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee log

(bridge par= <var>file</var> | <var>cmd2</var> ...) 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee log
    </pre>
