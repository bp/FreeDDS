    <p>
      While each definition "<b>value</b>" contains every character from 
      the "=" character to the beginning of the next definition (including
      any and all "white space"), the definition "<b>value</b>" is further
      broken down into "<b>tokens</b>" which exclude are separated by 
      "white space" (with the exception of any "white space" that is
      either escaped with "\" or is included inside double quotes.
      The following table has several examples showing the "<b>tokens</b>"
      for the definition <code>foo</code>.

    <pre>    
     DEFINITION          TOKEN1   TOKEN2    TOKEN3
     ------------------  -------  -------   -------
 1)  foo= caca           "caca"      -         -
 2)  foo=caca widget     "caca"   "widget"     -
 3)  foo= caca widget    "caca"   "widget"  "thing"        
          thing 
 4)  foo=bar=caca...        -        -         -
 5)  foo= "tkn 1" caca   "tkn 1"  "caca"    "this &amp; that"
      "this &amp; that"
    </pre>

    <p>
      Once again, be careful with the command shell interacting with the
      special characters.  For example, if you use double quotes to define
      tokens with white space or "<code>=</code>" characters, the 
      command shell will strip off the quotes, leaving the tokens to be
      split up by the "white space" into more tokens.  You can use single
      quotes outside the double quotes or more easily you can put the
      definitions in a <a href="par.html">Par File</a>.
