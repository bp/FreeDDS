    <p>
      Application are controlled by command line arguments. These arguments
      are copied into a temporary file and interpreted as a Dictionary. 
      These eventually get copied into all output Data Dictionaries 
      (along with the input Dictionary). This provides a comprehensive
      history that can be used to evaluate processing or repeat it again.

    <p>
      Care must be taken, when definitions are placed on the command line.
      Special characters must be protected from shell interpretation.
      These include:
      <code>#, &quot;, ', *, ?, $, (, ), &lt;, &gt;, |, &amp;</code>. 
      Shell documentation should be consulted, if these characters are 
      used on the command line.  It can be easier in these cases to put
      them into a "par" file, where the shell interpretation does not get
      involved.
