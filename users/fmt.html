    <p>
      Data structures of existing binary data are described using derived
      "fmt" Definitions. These are used in conjunction with the basic DDS
      format which define the "root" structure(s). For example, <b>usp</b>
      is the root name for the USP format.  Derived fmt Definitions are
      saved in the Dictionary used to describe the data.

    <p>
      DDS "fmt" Definitions describe the fundamental structures used for 
      data transfer and buffer mapping using the 
      <a href="datatypes/independent.html">prime types</a> predefined by
      DDS. Additional format Definitions may be derived by combining 
      prime types and other format definitions. Derived types include
      USP_TRACE, RecNum, and USP_SHORT. Prime types include integer2,
      integer4, float4, and float8ibm.

    <p>
      DDS structure specifications are analogous to structured types in
      the "C" programming languages, with a few exceptions. DDS structures
      are portable, i.e. host independent. Pointers are not supported.
      Conversion routines are provided between most DDS types and 
      intrinsic types on the host computer.

    <p>
      Most of the data fmt specifications are already setup in fmt
      Dictionaries. However, users can redefine them, define new formats
      or modify any of the existing formats.
