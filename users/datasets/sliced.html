    <p>
      There is a DDS Application Program (see "mergeND") that can merge 
      together multiple datasets in several different ways.  However, it
      would be nice to be able to combine multiple datasets without having
      to read, process and write the data output another combined dataset
      taking up more processing time and disk space.  Using a 
      "<b>sliced</b>" dataset can combine multiple, conformable datasets
      directly by creating a super, sliced Dictionary.
    </p>

    <p>
      A "<b>sliced</b>" can be created simply by creating a master DDS 
      super Dictionary containing a format, axis, size, and other 
      appropriate data Definitions. Each file <u>MUST</u> be identical
      in axis and size's, and assumed to be the same in delta's, origin's
      and etc.  The new "<code>axis</code>" definition in the super
      Dictionary will contain an extra axis token representing the multiple
      files.  The "size" Definitions must reflect the correct sizes for
      each axis with the "size" of the extra slice axis equal to the 
      number of sliced datasets. (Actually, multiple axes can be sliced
      as long as the product of all the sliced axes equals the total
      number of datasets specified by the new "<code>data=</code>"
      Definition).  The format Definition must reflect the format for
      each of the files as well as a "slice" attribute (such as 
      "<code>slice.h</code>" or "<code>slice.3</code>") indicating which
      axis is sliced (multiple axes can be sliced). 
      The data Definition must be a list of datasets containing the same
      number of dataset names as defined by the corresponding "size"
      Definition for the "sliced" axis. See the following example:
    </p>

    <pre>
axis=t x z y
size.t=150
size.x=81
size.y=30
size.z=4
delta.t=0.002
units.t=sec
format=usp slice.z
data=Offset1000.data
     Offset2000.data
     Offset3000.data 
     Offset4000.data
    </pre>

    <p>
      <b>NOTE1:</b> Slicing of datasets CANNOT be nested.  In otherwords, 
      all actual non-sliced files MUST be specified by the "data=" 
      definition in the super dictionary.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>NOTE2:</b> any history Definitions that need to be carried on must
      be in the super Dictionary.  To retain history, it's a good idea to copy
      one of the individual dataset dictionaries and modify it by adding the
      new essential Definitions ("<b>axis=</b>", "<b>format=</b>", 
      "<b>data=</b>", and "size", "delta" and "origin" for the newly
      created sliced axis).
    </p>

    <p>
      Better yet, use the DDS script utility, "<code>makedict</code>" which
      does all this for you.
