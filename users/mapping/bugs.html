    <!*********************************************************************>

    <p>
      Field mapping is limited and buggy in the current version of DDS.
      Priorities have not allowed the initial version of this code to be
      cleaned up, much less enhanced.

    <p>
      Mapping Definitions are effective on scalar fields (array size == 1).
      However, when mapping to a vector field (array size > 1), a scalar
      value is computed and assigned to the first element. Subsequent
      vector elements are zeroed. This is not a problem for most Trace
      Header fields, because they are scalars. 

    <p>
      The "Samples" field is a vector associated with each data Trace.
      It is treated like any other header field. Precisely the same name 
      is used in all DDS types that contain trace data. Map Definitions
      are carefully avoided for the Samples field.
