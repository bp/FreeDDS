    <p>
      DDS has the capability of compressing traces using the zip lossless
      compression on each trace.  A trace table is built on-the-fly when
      writing the traces.  This table is flushed out to the end of the binary 
      data upon closing the binary file. When the binary is opened again, the 
      trace table is reloaded into the system for use.  Thus, an application
      can do trace seeks (not byte seeks) when either reading or writing
      traces; however it cannot seek past the end-of-file. Seeks, as always,
      are not allowed on piped datasets except when seeking forward, in which 
      case a simple read/write is done.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Be aware</b> that normal seismic data does not compress very well
      with lossless compression.  However, datasets with a lot of constant
      values (such as velocity models and sparse datasets with lots of zeros)
      do compress well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data compression is specified by adding a format attribute of
      "<code>zip</code>" with an optional compression level (1-9) which
      defaults to 6 (the normal gzip default level). For example: 
      "<code>out_format= fcube zip</code>".  The "<code>zip</code>" attribute
      is not carried over by default to a following output format; it must 
      always be specified for each output file for each program.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      <b>NOTE: zip compression will not work with programs that do random access on 
        those files or with programs that use MPI with each node writing to a zip file.
      </b>
    </p>
