    <p>
      The structure of traces can be described, similar to Line Headers
      in the previous subsection. This allows standard and generic trace
      formats to be specified with the same DDS notation. Seamless Seismic
      Data Access is facilitated by this common framework.

    <p>
      All fields in a trace are created equal; DDS does not discriminate
      between headers and Samples. Traces may contains many fields, or only 
      one. The seismic Samples field, if it exists, normally has the size
      defined by the first axis. Operations that can be applied to headers,
      can also be applied to Samples, and visa versa.

    <p>
      Fields may have any binary data type supported by DDS. Types are not
      limited to those supported by the host computer. The list includes
      <b>character</b>, <b>unsigned</b>, <b>integer</b>, <b>float</b>,
      and <b>complex</b>. Binary representations include <b>ieee</b>,
      <b>ibm</b>, <b>ascii</b>, and <b>ebcdic</b>.  All the
      supported data types are described in the
      <a href="../datatypes.html">Data Types</a> section.

    <p>
      Each field has a constant element count. If the count is greater than
      one, the field is a vector. If equal to one, its a scalar. If zero,
      no storage is reserved for a value.
