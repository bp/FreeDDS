    <p>
      Along with each input and output datasets is an associated Data
      Dictionary.  If a standard binary (eg. usp or segy) is opened without
      a Dictionary, a temporary, internal Dictionary will be created.
      On output, a standard binary can be created without it's associated
      Dictionary.

    <p>
      The chronological sequence of definitions in Data Dictionaries
      provide a history describing the processing steps along with the
      parameters and binary data.  Each application program that uses
      DDS marks its place in history with a title.  This title section
      provides:

    <ol>
      <li>A title of the process
      <li>The path to the binary that was executed
      <li>Application Revision number
      <li>The user name that did the processing
      <li>The date and time the processing began
      <li>The machine name where the processing was preformed
      <li>The subdirectory from which the execution began
      <li>The main pid number of the process
    </ol>

    <p>
      Here is an example excerpt of the title section:

    <pre>
DDS_SENTRY= $Revision: 1 $ $Date: 2009-01-05 18:31:13 -0600 (Mon, 05 Jan 2009) $
********************************************
******************* TITLE ******************
********************************************
cmd_title= transpose: transpose multi-dimensional datasets
cmd_name= /appsdist/SunOS/5/mbs/prod/sun4d/transpose
cmd_rev= 1.7
cmd_user= billy01
cmd_date= Thu Apr 10 15:36:39 1997
cmd_host= machine1
cmd_cwd= /data1/mig3d/nigeria
cmd_pid= 3963
    </pre>

    <p>
      After the title section are all the user supplied parameters
      followed by application definitions introduced by the processing 
      step.  Here is an example excerpt:

    <pre>
dds_history= par:
cmd_args=
in=line2.usp
out_format=asp
out=line2_asp
dds_history_end= par:
    </pre>

    <p>
      Following this is the format definitions which define the input,
      internal and output binary formats.  Also, any USP input binary
      without an associated Dictionary will cause DDS to retain all
      USP HLH (Historical Line Header) informat as a series of 
      "<code>previous_history</code>" definitions which are use to
      restore the USP HLH whenever recreating another USP output binary.
