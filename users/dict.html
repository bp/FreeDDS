    <p>
      Dictionaries contain a chronological sequence of 
      <a href="definitions.html">definitions</a>.
      DDS will normally scanf for definitions from the bottom up 
      looking for the latest definition when there are multiple
      occurances for the same definition name. Each Dictionary is
      identified by its filename or a special mnemonic for internal
      dictionaries.  Because anything written to a Dictionary will
      become a part of a Definition.  Therefore, if you want to add
      a comment to a Dictionary, <u>DO NOT</u> simply do something like
      adding a "#" at the begining of a line.  Instead simply create
      a new Definition with a name that is not normally used for anything
      such as "comment=...".  All Definitions can expand across multipl
      lines until the next Definition is encountered.

    <h3>Dictionary filenames have a few constraints:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>They should not terminate with &quot;:&quot; (colon).
        These names are reserved for mnemonic dictionaries.<br/><br/>

      <li>Filenames must not contain &quot;=&quot;, white space, or
        control characters, as this would conflict with the basic
        definition structure.<br/><br/>

      <li>It is reccommended that other special characters and "white
        space" not be used in filename.  Although this is possible, it
        can create confusion and difficulty dealing with these unusual
        types of filenames.<br/><br/>

      <li> Users may follow additional conventions. For example,
        dictionaries that describe binary data may be prefixed by "H"
        (History).
    </ul>

    <p>
      By default, disk files are created in the current working directory.
      The use of <var>DATA_PATH</var>  
      (see <a href="runtime.html">Runtime Control</a>) can be used to create
      Binary files in other directories.
