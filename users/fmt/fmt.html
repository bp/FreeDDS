    <p>
      Fmt definition names are prefixed by "<code>fmt:</code>". Each 
      Definition must be a "typedef" type. Arrays may also be define
      with zero elements to define a place-holder. They are compiled
      into internal symbol tables, when binary data is opened.

    <p>
      All typedef structures have an associated name. Derived types may
      be simple or compound. Simple types contain a single field.
      Compound types are either structures (sequence of fields) or unions
      (coincident fields). Compound structures may also contain gaps,
      which reserve storage that is not accessible by field name.
      Each field, within a structure, must have a unique name (subtype).
      Recursive structures are not allowed.

    <p>
      The modifier "<b>align</b>" may be specified. The position is a
      multiple of the specified integer, relative to offset zero within
      the parent structure. If "align" is not specified, alignment is
      inherited from the subtype.

    <p>
      When a file is opened, DDS determines the <var>format</var> and
      and then begins to compile the format at the top level base fmt
      specification for that format:

    <pre>
fmt:<var>format</var>=
    typedef <var>FORMAT</var>_LINE PREAMBLE;  /* define line header    */
    typedef <var>FORMAT</var>_TRACE SEQUENCE; /* define trace sequence */
    </pre>

    This will define any Line Header structures and along with the Trace
    Sequence (Trace Headers including Samples).  The compilation process
    continues on by searching for the various derived fmt definitions
    until the entire structure can be digested (defined) in terms of 
    all the prime data types.  So the next step would search further
    for in the Dictionaries for the following fmt Definitions such as:

    <pre>
fmt:<var>FORMAT</var>_TRACE=
    typedef structure {
       <var>FORMAT</var>_SHORT TVPair[200][2]; 
       <var>FORMAT</var>_INT dummy_gap[0]; /* zero-lenth vector */
       .
       .
       .
       <var>FORMAT</var>_INT Fold; 
       SAMPLE_TYPE Samples[axis_size(1)]; /* trace samples */

    } <var>FORMAT</var>_TRACE;

fmt:<var>FORMAT</var>_SHORT= integer2
fmt:<var>FORMAT</var>_INT= integer
fmt:SAMPLE_TYPE= float
    </pre>

    <p>
      The number of samples used in the above structure is specified using
      one of the DDS built-in <a href="functions.html">funcitons</a>,
      "<b>axis_size()</b>".
