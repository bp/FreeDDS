    <p>The pick in xsd is simply a set of 2-Dimensional poly-lines in the 2D
      plane defined by the first plotted vertical axis and the first plotted
      horizontal axis.  The individual points are called "picks" and each set
      of picks are called "segments". Every pick segment is contained to the 2D 
      plane from which its first pick is selected.  Each segment will be displayed
      on all the other Display Windows that match the same displayed 2D plane 
      (transposed or not) that has the same axis values for all the other axes. 
      See <a href="savingloading.html">Saving/Loading</a> to save and restore pick 
      segments.</p>

    <p>The current pick/segment editing mode is displayed in the 
      "<code>Edit Mode:</code>" status window.  By default each Display Window is
      setup to begin in the "<code>Picking</code>" mode. Pressing on the
      <b>left mouse button</b> will add a "pick" to the working "segment"; the
      <b>middle mouse button</b> will remove the previous "pick"; the 
      <b>right mouse button</b> will close out the picking for the working 
      "segment" and add that "segment" to the list of active segments.  The 
      <a href="picking/picks.html">Picks</a> and 
      <a href="picking/segments.html">Segment</a> menus control picking and
      "segment" editing.</p>
