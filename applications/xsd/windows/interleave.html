    <p>The Interleave Window is a composite of two Display Window images. Every other
      pixel of the composite image is taken alternating from the two images that makes
      up the Interleave image. The controls are very much like that in the Display Windows
      except that there are two color control panels (one for each image). The first
      selected image is controlled by the top color control panel and the second image
      is controlled by the bottom control panel. When the "<code>Global Colors</code>"
      toggle is selected, the top color panel controls are globally tied to the color
      controls of all the Display Windows and the bottom color control panels are tied
      to the second control panel on any other composite window.</p><br clear="all" />
