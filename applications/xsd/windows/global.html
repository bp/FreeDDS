    <p>Select the "Window&rarr;Global" menu button to pop-up the "Global Selection
      Window". Various types of functions can be done on multiple Display Windows.
      The top area shows all the current available Display Windows.  Double click
      on any of them to add them to the selected list below.  Double click on the lower
      Selected List to remove any.  You can also click on the "<b>Select All</b>" button
      to select all Display Windows from the top list to the bottom Selected List or 
      "<b>Clear All</b>" button to clear the entire Selected List.</p>

    Once you have the desired Display Window(s) selected you can perform any of the 
    following tasks:      
    <ul>
      <li>"<b>Hide</b>" the selected Display Windows. Any of these can be redisplayed
        by "exposing" them either through this "Global Selection Window" or through
        the "Window&rarr;Expose&nbsp;Window" menu button.  This can also be done on
        any specific Display Window by clicking on the "Window&rarr;Hide&nbsp;Window"
        menu button.</li>

      <li>"<b>Expose</b>" the selected Display Windows. If they were Hidden 
        previously, then will be exposed.  This can also be done on any single
        window by popping up the Expose Window by clicking on the 
        "Window&rarr;Expose&nbsp;Window" menu button and then selecting a Display 
        Window to expose.</li>

      <li>"<b>Delete</b>" the selected Display Windows.  Once deleted they cannot
        be recovered other than to <a href="data.html">reload</a> them again.</li>

      <li>"<b>Animate</b>" the multiple selected Display Windows. This allows you
        to rapidly animate through multiple Display Windows which helps to make
        subtle comparisons of the various data images (See 
        <a href="windows/animation.html">Animation</a>).</li>

      <li>"<b>Overlay</b>" the one or more selected Wiggle Displays on top of a
        Display Windows.  The order of the selection does not matter. It will only
        allow one non-Wiggle Display which will be used as the background for all
        the selected Wiggle images to be displayed.  This is useful for displaying
        wiggles overlay-ed onto the corresponding velocity image (See 
        <a href="windows/overlay.html">Overlay</a>).</li>

      <li>"<b>Interleave</b>" the two selected Display Windows where every other
        pixel is taken alternating from the two Display Window images (See 
        <a href="windows/interleave.html">Interleave</a>).</li>

      <li>"<b>RGBI</b>" the three or four selected Display Windows.  The first selected
        Display Window image will be mapped into Red, the second will be mapped into
        Green, the third into Blue and if a fourth is selected it will be mapped into
        intensity.  If a fourth image is not selected then the intensity is calculated
        from the three images (See <a href="windows/rgbi.html">RGBI</a>).  This is 
        extremely helpful in displaying spectral images.</li>

      <li>"<b>Load Colormap</b>" for the selected Display Windows (see 
        <a href="colors.html">Colors</a>).</li>

      <li>"<b>Save Images</b>" of the selected Display Windows (see 
        <a href="savingloading.html">Saving/Loading</a>).</li>

      <li>"<b>Delete Images</b>" that had previously been saved.</li>
    </ul>
