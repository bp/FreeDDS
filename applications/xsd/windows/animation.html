    <p>The Animation Window is a composite of multiple Display Windows which can animate
      rapidly through all the data images.  The only difference in the controls is the
      animation control area just below the menu panel.  The "<code>Play</code>" button
      will animate through the images with the delay between each image as specified by
      the "<code>Movie Delay (ms)</code>" value. The images can be stepped through one
      at a time either forward ("<code>Step-&gt;</code>") or reverse 
      ("<code>&lt;-Step</code>") direction. The animation window is deleted by either
      clicking on the "<code>Quit</code>" button or selecting 
      "Window&rarr;Delete&nbsp;Window" from the menu panel.</p>

    <p>The other controls behave pretty much the same way as with the basic Display
      Windows. The act upon the corresponding Display image currently displayed. Anything
      done to the image will also act upon the original Display Window.</p>
