    <p>The Display Windows are identified by a Sequence # and a Window Id # which
      are displayed in the window Title bar along with the filename and selection
      parameters.  The Sequence # is a simple number that starts
      from 1 and increments for each window opened up.  The Window Id # also starts
      from 1 and increments, however, as windows get deleted, those Window Id numbers
      can be reused.  The Window Id # is the key identification number for each window.
      The data is displayed with the Sample amplitudes mapped to an editable colormap
      for each window.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><u>Annotation:</u><br />
        The annotation can be referenced by "<b>index</b>", "<b>base/step</b>" or
        "<b>delta/origin</b>" as selected by the "<code>Ref by:</code>" option.  These
        values and axis names were defined for each axis in the
         <a href="data/definition.html">Data Definition</a> section of the Server 
            Parameters.  The Axis names can be set to show up as whatever you want.
        <ul>
          <li>Each axis with more than one selected value is plotted and annotated
            in the Vertical or Horizontal direction as specified in the 
            <a href="data/definition.html">Data Selection</a> section of the Server 
            Parameters in the order specified.</li>

	  <li>Moving the cursor around on the data will change the odometer (right
	    side of the "<code>Ref by:</code>" option). The odometer shows the axis 
	    values in addition to the data Amplitude (with the precision possible 
	    within a single byte) and up to three selected trace header values 
	    (selected from menu Options&rarr;Trace&nbsp;Header&nbsp;Item&nbsp;#).<br /><br />
            <center><img src="xsd_DataWindow.jpg" alt=""></center><br />
	    While actually making picks, any trace header values will be replaced
	    with the Slope and Velocity values (in the units as selected by the 
	    "<code>Ref by:</code>" option.<br /><br />
            <center><img src="xsd_Odometer.jpg" alt=""></center>
	    </li>
        </ul><br />

      </li>

      <li><u>Color Control:</u><br />
        The colormap can be interactively modified by modifying the Contrast and/or
        Bias scales. This can be beneficial in enhancing desired data features.
        Pressing the "<code>Cont</code>" or "<code>Bias</code>" buttons will reset
        the corresponding scales. Setting the "<code>Global Colors</code>" toggle
        on this window (or any other Display Window) will cause any Contrast and/or 
        Bias changes to be applied to every Display Window. See 
        <a href="colors.html">"Colors"</a> to change or edit colormaps.</li>

      <li><u>Scroll Control:</u><br />
        When the displayed data image is larger than the Display Window, the horizontal
        and vertical scroll bars will appear to allow scrolling around on the image.
        Selecting the "<code>Global Scroll</code>" toggle will cause and scrolling to
        be applied to every Display Window.
      </li>

      <li><u>Cursor Control:</u><br />
        When comparing data in multiple windows it is sometimes helpful to have the
        cursor show up in each window at the corresponding locations.  To turn on
        this feature, select the "<code>Global Cursor</code>" toggle.  Slave cursors
        will be positioned in each window (in black) at the correct location (same
        axis indeces) even if the data is displayed differently.  Whenever the 
        same data location does not exist, no cursor will show up in that window.
        For any window that has the 
        <a href="picking/segments.html#toggles">Honor Records</a>
        toggle turned off, the cursor will simply be shown at the same relative image
        "x" and "y" pixel coordinates. Whenever the "<code>Global Cursor</code>" toggle
        is changed, all the "<code>Global Cursor</code>" toggles for each existing
        window is set to the same state.
      </li>

      <li><u>Scale/Offset:</u><br />
        The "Scale" and "Offset" values that were used to display the current data is
        shown.  For example, if the data was scaled with Maximum or some Histogram 
        scaling, other data can be displayed with the exact same scaling by applying
        this "Scale" and "Offset" values with the "Fixed" scaling.
      </li>

      <li><u>Mode:</u><br />
        The editing "Mode" is displayed to indicated the current type of editing setup
        by the various "Segment" or "Picks" menu options 
        (see <a href="picking.html">"Picking"</a>).
