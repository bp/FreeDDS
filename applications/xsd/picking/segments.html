    <p>Use the "Segment" menu to select the "<code>Edit Mode</code>" which controls 
      editing picks within existing segments.  Segments are defined in a 2D plane as
      defined by the first plotted vertical axis and first plotted horizontal axis.
      Segment colors can be edited by selecting the
      "<a href="../colors.html">Color&rarr;Edit&nbsp;Segment&nbsp;Colors</a>" menu item.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><u><b>Segment Editing</b></u><br />
        <ul>
          <li><img src="xsd_SegmentMenu.jpg" alt="" align="right" style="padding:0 0 0 20px">
            <u>Add Segments:</u><br />
            This is the default option when a Display Window is first created.  It will 
            setup to add new pick segments. Pressing  the <b>left mouse button</b> will
            set the first pick of a new segment.  Where ever this pick is position
            determines the 2D segment plane where all picks are contained. Continuing
            to press the <b>left mouse button</b> will add more picks.  Press the
            <b>middle mouse button</b> to remove the last pick.  Press the
            <b>right mouse button</b> to terminate adding more picks and add the working
            segment to the active segment list for this XSD session. (NOTE: if only a 
            single pick is made, then the segment will not be created.  If you really
            desire to have a segment comprised of a single pick, then use 
            "Segment&rarr;Add&nbsp;Single&nbsp;point&nbsp;Segment".</li>

          <li><u>Add Single Point Segment:</u><br /> 
            This option creates a segment with only one pick.  Every time the 
            <b>left mouse button</b> is pressed, a single point segment is created.</li>

          <li><u>Move Segment:</u><br /> 
            This option moves segments within the established 2D segment plane. To select
            a segment to move, press the <b>left mouse button</b>.  The selected segment
            will change color.  Then you can use the <b>left mouse button</b> to drag
            the segment around, anywhere within the 2D plane.  Press the
            <b>right mouse button</b> to deselect the segment.  Then either select 
            another segment or change the "<code>Edit Mode</code>".</li>

          <li><u>Delete Segment:</u><br /> 
            This option deletes segments.  Press the <b>left mouse button</b> to select
            a segment (which will be highlighted).  Press the <b>right mouse button</b>
            to deselect the segment.  When a segment is selected, pressing the 
            <b>left mouse button</b> a second time will delete the selected segment.</li>

          <li><u>Copy Segments:</u><br /> 
            <img src="xsd_CopySegmentsWindow.jpg" alt="" align="right" style="padding:0 0 0 20px">
            This option allows you to copy all the segments from one 2D segment plane to
            other planes.  For each Axis outside the 2D segment plane select the axis value
            "<code>From</code>" which to copy the segments.  Then select the axis values
            to copy the segment to starting from the "<code>To</code>" values through
            the "<code>End</code>" values incrementing by the "<code>Inc</code>" values.
            Press the "<code>OK</code>" button to copy the segments or "<code>Cancel</code>"
            to not copy them.  The "<code>Edit Mode</code> does not change.
            <br clear="all" /></li>

          <li><u>Duplicate Segment:</u><br /> 
            This option duplicates segments. Press the <b>left mouse button</b> to select
            a segment (which will be highlighted).  Press the <b>right mouse button</b>
            to deselect the segment.  When a segment is selected, pressing the 
            <b>left mouse button</b> a second time will duplicate the selected segment.
            The duplicated segment will be offset 3 vertical pixels more.</li>

          <li><u>Refine Segment:</u><br /> 
            This option will add addition picks in between each existing picks of a
            selected segment. Press the <b>left mouse button</b> to select a segment 
            (which will be highlighted).  Press the <b>right mouse button</b> to
            deselect the segment. Each time the <b>left mouse button</b> is pressed
            when a segment is selected, addition picks are added halfway between each
            existing picks.</li>

          <li><u>Split Segment:</u><br /> 
            This option is used to split an existing segment into two segments. Select
            a segment by pressing the <b>left mouse button</b> which will highlight the
            selected segment.  Press the <b>right mouse button</b> to deselect the segment
            without splitting it or press the <b>left mouse button</b> again to split the
            segment up at the closest pick point.  No segment is selected after that.</li>

          <li><u>Join Segment:</u><br /> 
            This option joins two segments. Select a segment by pressing the 
            <b>left mouse button</b> which will highlight the selected segment and mark
            the end point of the selected segment (closest to the cursor) with a "&Chi;".
            Then press the <b>left mouse button</b> again closest to the end point of
            another segment you wish to join to the selected segment.  Press  the
            <b>right mouse button</b> to deselect the segment.</li>

          <li><u>Label Segment:</u><br /> 
            <img src="xsd_LabelWindow.jpg" alt="" align="right" style="padding:0 0 0 20px">
            This option allows you to label the pick segments. Select a segment by pressing 
            the <b>left mouse button</b>. Pressing it again will bring up the Input Label
            Window.  Type in what you want for the label (no blank spaces). Press the
            "<code>OK</code>" button to accept the change or "<code>Cancel</code>" to 
            close the Window.<br clear="all" /></li>

          <li><u>Clear All Segments:</u><br /> 
            This option will remove ALL pick segments.  A verification window will pop-up
            first to prevent inadvertently clearing them.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><u><b>Segment I/O</b></u><br />
        There are two type of XSD pick files.  The "Old Format" is based on the old USP
        format which only has Samples, Traces and Records (3D).  When dealing with this
        old format, XSD treats all axes from 3 on as simple records.  The "New Format"
        pickfile if based on N-Dimensional datasets.  Pick segments are 2D poly-lines 
        in the plane defined by the first vertical and first horizontal plot axes. 
        Each segment is associated with the axes by their values.
        <ul>
          <li><u>Load Segments:</u><br /> 
            This option will load previously save pick segments.  A file selection
            window will pop-up to allow you to select a pickfile to load.  It will 
            automatically detect whether the pickfile is an "Old Format" or "New Format"
            pickfile.  The pick segments will be read and displayed on all the Display
            Windows where the corresponding 2D segment plane exists.</li>

          <li><u>Load Segments Remote:</u><br /> 
            This is similar to the "<code>Load Segments</code>" option except the pickfile
            is accessed remotely through the ddsServer.</li>

          <li><u>Load Segments from Surfaces:</u><br /> 
            <img src="xsd_ReadSurfaceWindow.jpg" alt="" align="right" style="padding:0 0 0 20px">
            This option will create segment picks by reading surfaces from a dataset. The
            dataset must have the same axes as the data being displayed except for the
            display vertical axis which is taken from the surface values.  The surface
            data selection window has a text widget to read the 
            "<code>Surface Scale Factor</code>" which is used to scale the surface
            Sample values to values compatible with the plotted vertical axis scale. The 
            "<code>Edit Mode</code> does not change.<br clear="all" /></li>
 
         <li><u>Save Segments:</u><br /> 
            <img src="xsd_SavePicksWindow.jpg" alt="" align="right" style="padding:0 0 0 20px">
            This option will save all the pick segments to a pickfile. A file selection
            window will pop-up to allow you to select a pickfile which to save the picks
            as well.  After selecting a filename to use, a Save Picks Window will pop-up
            allowing you to select whether to use the "Old Format" or "New Format".  If
            "<code>Old XSD Pick Format</code>" then the Units and Offsets are enabled
            to for the old format.</li>
 
         <li><u>Save Segments Remote:</u><br /> 
            This is similar to the "<code>Save Segments</code>" option except the pickfile
            is created remotely through the ddsServer.</li>
