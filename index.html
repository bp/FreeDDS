    <center><h2>WELCOME TO DDS</h2></center>

    <p>
    The <u><b>D</b></u>ata <u><b>D</b></u>ictionary <u><b>S</b></u>ystem
    is an I/O System (and much more) capable of handling multi-dimensional
    seismic datasets (up to 9 dimensions; eg. 
    <b>"axis= t offset shot x y"</b>) in various formats including
    <a href="http://www.freeusp.org">usp</a> (BP Amoco's 
    <u><b>U</b></u>n*x <u><b>S</b></u>eismic <u><b>P</b></u>rocessing), 
    <a href="http://seg.org/publications/tech-stand/seg_y_rev0.pdf">segy</a>
    (<u><b>S</b></u>ociety of <u><b>E</b></u>xploration 
    <u><b>G</b></u>eophysicists SEG-Y format), 
    <a href="http://seg.org/publications/tech-stand/seg_y_rev1.pdf">
      segy1</a> (SEG's SEG-Y Rev 1.0 format),
    <a href="http://sepwww.stanford.edu">sep</a> (<u><b>S</b></u>tanford 
    <u><b>E</b></u>xploration <u><b>P</b></u>roject's format), 
    <a href="http://www.cwp.mines.edu/cwpcodes/index.html">su</a>
    (Colorado School of Mine's <u><b>S</b></u>eismic <u><b>U</b></u>n*x 
    format) as well as other flexible trace definitions (with or without
    trace headers) such as <b>fcube</b>.  DDS allows different processing
    systems to be used together by piping directly together as well
    as through actual emulation of different processing systems.

    <p>
      A DDS dataset normally consists of a Dictionary and Binary data. 
      A DDS Dictionary is a text file consisting of free-form Definitions, 
      each given by a Definition name, an equal symbol (&quot;=&quot;) and
      a value which can be nearly anything without an &quot;=&quot;
      character. The command line can be used to override any Dictionary
      Definitions. Also, a &quot;par&quot; file containing command line
      definitions can be specified on the command line by 
      <b>par=</b><i>filename</i>.
      
    <p>
      The Dictionary defines the Binary data format and contains any
      accumulated processing history. The underlying data model for the
      Dictionary uses data structural syntax similar to the &quot;C&quot;
      programming language. The Binary data is normally in a separate file
      from the Dictionary and is pointed to by the Dictionary. The Binary
      can, however, be attached to the end of the Dictionary in order to
      keep the dataset contained in a single physical file. Specific formats
      like <b>usp</b> or <b>segy</b> are already predefined within DDS and
      can therefore exist as a single binary file without the need for a 
      Dictionary in which case they default to 3D data with 
      <b>axis= t x y</b>.
      
    <p>
      DDS also has multi-file support where multiple conformable files
      can be arbitrarily merged for processing by simply creating a master
      Dictionary file pointing to the various individual files.  It has
      been used in production on many different systems including CM5, 
      Cray, Sun, SGI, Linux, Lunix clusters (32 &amp; 64 bit); and even 
      tested on several others.  It is currently used in production on 
      large Terabyte datasets with MPI and OpenMP parallelization.
      
    <p>
      DDS is being offered in open source by <b>BP America Inc</b> under 
      <a href="http://www.freeusp.org/DDS">FreeDDS</a> along with a small
      collection of seismic imaging programs and associated utilities.
