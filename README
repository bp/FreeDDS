 NOTE: DDS should already be setup to make for the following systems.  
       If a specific system needs to be added or modified, see 
       README.config.
        
           SunOS 5.6 sun4u
           SunOS 5.8 sun4u
           IRIX64
           IRIX32 n32
           IRIX32
           Linux 2.4 i686
           Linux 2.4 ia64
           Linux 2.4 x86_64
           Linux 2.6 PPC64
           Mac OS High Sierra x86_64
           Windows x86_64 (mingw cross compilation from Linux host)

HOW TO INSTALL THE DDS LIBRARIES FROM SOURCE CODE:

 1) The following environmental variables must first be set.

          DDSROOT set to the root DDS directory (eg. DDS.2003-07-01).
               This is used by all the make files in identifying DDS 
               subdirectories during the making of libraries and 
               applications.

          DDS_DIST set to the base location to install the applications.
               The "bin", "man" and architecture-dependent directories
               get installed under $DDS_DIST.  During the installation
               of the "host" library, dds-set-path gets installed under
               $DDS_DIST/bin.

 2) Execute "gmake" from this root DDS directory to build AND install 
    "fhost", "chost", "gio", "dds_r3", "fftw3", "fftw3f" and "fft" libraries 
    for the local machine.  (You can alternately go into each of the 
    src/lib directories, run "gmake" and "gmake install"; just make 
    sure you do that in the above order.)

 3) If you have downloaded and untarred the documentation under the dds
    root, then just point your browser to ${DDSROOT}/doc/html/index.html.
    You will need to have php implemented inorder to make use of the search
    engine and a few other things.

 4) After these libraries are installed, you should than have the following
    DDS libararies installed under  ${DDSROOT}/lib/<ARCHDIRS>,  then look 
    at the README.app for building the DDS applications.

      libdds_r3.a - core DDS API routines
      libchost.a  - host dependent routines for 'c' programs
      libfhost.a  - host dependent routines for Fortran programs
      libgio.a    - generalized buffered I/O routines for DDS
      libfft.a    - basic fft wrappers for different platforms
      libfftw3.a  - double precision fftw Rev 3 routines from fftw.org 
                    used by fft wrappers on platforms that do not have 
                    good fft's in place.
      libfftw3f.a - single precision fftw routines.

 You probably will need to download the DDS documentation (or go to the 
 DDS website) for both the use of DDS as well as the API calls for
 application developers.

 The other README files include:

    README.doc          - describes installation of the DDS documentation.

    README.app          - describes installation of the DDS libraries 
                          from the source code.

    README.int          - describes the DDS directory tree internals

    README.config       - describes briefly how to modify DDS to build 
                          on a different platform.

    README.makeexamples - provides more information on using the DDS
                          make scheme.

    README.makescheme   - provides some of the reasoning behind the DDS
                          make scheme.
