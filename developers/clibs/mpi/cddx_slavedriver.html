    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>
      <b>cddx_slavedriver</b> provides a template for a master-slave parallelization. 
      Parallel programming is non-trivial. 
      The goal of this routines is to provide a framework for the developer,
      so that they may concentrate on the algorithm, rather than the parallelism.
      That said, thought should be given to the level of parallelism required
      in any application.  If the level of parallelism is too fine (the 
      jobs are too short) then there is a potential for a bottleneck with
      the inter-process communication. If the level parallelism is too coarse 
      (the jobs are too long), then you may not be able to use many threads.
    </p>
    <p>
      The runtime parameter <i>masterslave_debug=</i> can control the behaviour of this routine for debugging purposes.<br>
      Valid values are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>0: normal mode, with no debugging (this it the default value).</li>
      <li>1: the master will stop after giving one job out.</li>
      <li>2: the master will stop after giving one job out to each slave.</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h2>INPUT</h2>
    <p>
      The parameter, "<i>np</i>", specifies the number of MPI threads used by the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parameter, "<i>node</i>", specifies the number of the current MPI thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parameter, "<i>numjobs</i>", specifies the total number of jobs to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parameter, "<i>verbose</i>", specifies whether to print fewer
      (<i>verbose=0</i>) or more messages (<i>verbose=1</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The parameter, "<i>mydata</i>", specifies a work array (or just a pointer
      if you are mixing Fortran and C) of data that can be used by the used-defined
      functions that follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parameter, "<i>Slave_Work</i>", defines a subroutine that will be 
      called by the slaves to do a single element of work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parameter, "<i>Slave_SendResult</i>", defines a subroutine that 
      will be called by the slaves to send back results of a single element of work.<br>
      Note that if the slaves are keeping all of the results until the end, then
      this routine may be empty, but it must exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parameter, "<i>Slave_SendFinalResults</i>", defines a subroutine
      that will be called by the slaves,
      after they have finished all the jobs, to send back any final results.<br>
      Note that if the slaves are sending back individual results after completing 
      each job, then this routine may be empty, but it must exist.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      The parameter, "<i>Master_ReceiveResult</i>", defines a subroutine 
      that will be called by the master to receive results of a single element of work.<br>
      Note that if the slaves are keeping all of the results until the end, then
      this routine may be empty, but it must exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parameter, "<i>Master_ReceiveFinalResults</i>", defines a 
      subroutine that will be called by the master,
      after the slaves have finished all the jobs, to receive any final results.<br>
      Note that if the slaves are sending back individual results after 
      completing each job, then this routine may be empty, but it must exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parameter, "<i>Master_BroadcastResults</i>", defines a subroutine
      that will be <u>called by the master AND the slaves</u>,
      after the slaves have finished all the jobs, to receive any final results.<br>
      Note that this routine may be empty, but it must exist.
    </p>
