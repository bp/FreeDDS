      These are a series of "C" routines, callable from Fortran, to simplify writing codes that require a (possibly anisotropic) velocity model.<br>
      A generic API allows implementation details to be hidden and for the user to specify the type of velocity at run-time.<br>
      Currently implemented methods are homogeneous and a 3D grid.
