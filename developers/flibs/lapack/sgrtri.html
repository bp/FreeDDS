<pre class=man>SGETRI(3)                  LAPACK routine                 SGETRI(3)



<b>NAME</b>
       SGETRI - the inverse of a matrix using the LU factorization computed by
       SGETRF

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       SUBROUTINE SGETRI( N, A, LDA, IPIV, WORK, LWORK, INFO )

           INTEGER        INFO, LDA, LWORK, N

           INTEGER        IPIV( * )

           REAL           A( LDA, * ), WORK( * )

<b>PURPOSE</b>
       SGETRI computes the inverse of a matrix using the LU factorization com-
       puted by SGETRF.

       This  method  inverts  U and then computes inv(A) by solving the system
       inv(A)*L = inv(U) for inv(A).



<b>ARGUMENTS</b>
       N       (input) INTEGER
               The order of the matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

       A       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
               On entry, the factors L and U from the factorization A =  P*L*U
               as  computed  by  SGETRF.  On exit, if INFO = 0, the inverse of
               the original matrix A.

       LDA     (input) INTEGER
               The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

       IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
               The pivot indices from SGETRF; for 1&lt;=i&lt;=N, row i of the matrix
               was interchanged with row IPIV(i).

       WORK    (workspace/output) REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
               On exit, if INFO=0, then WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

       LWORK   (input) INTEGER
               The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK &gt;= max(1,N).  For opti-
               mal performance LWORK &gt;= N*NB, where NB is the  optimal  block-
               size returned by ILAENV.

               If  LWORK  = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
               only calculates the optimal size of  the  WORK  array,  returns
               this  value  as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
               message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

       INFO    (output) INTEGER
               = 0:  successful exit
               &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
               &gt; 0:  if INFO = i, U(i,i) is exactly zero; the matrix is singu-
               lar and its inverse could not be computed.
