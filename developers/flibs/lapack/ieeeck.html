<pre class=man>IEEECK(3)                  LAPACK routine                 IEEECK(3)

<b>NAME</b>
       IEEECK  -  called  from the ILAENV to verify that Infinity and possibly
       NaN arithmetic is safe (i.e

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       INTEGER FUNCTION IEEECK( ISPEC, ZERO, ONE )

           INTEGER      ISPEC

           REAL         ONE, ZERO

<b>PURPOSE</b>
       IEEECK is called from the ILAENV to verify that Infinity  and  possibly
       NaN arithmetic is safe (i.e. will not trap).



<b>ARGUMENTS</b>
       ISPEC   (input) INTEGER
               Specifies  whether  to  test  just  for inifinity arithmetic or
               whether to test for infinity and NaN arithmetic.  =  0:  Verify
               infinity arithmetic only.
               = 1: Verify infinity and NaN arithmetic.

       ZERO    (input) REAL
               Must  contain  the value 0.0 This is passed to prevent the com-
               piler from optimizing away this code.

       ONE     (input) REAL
               Must contain the value 1.0 This is passed to prevent  the  com-
               piler from optimizing away this code.

               RETURN  VALUE:   INTEGER = 0:  Arithmetic failed to produce the
               correct answers
               = 1:  Arithmetic produced the correct answers



               Return if we were only asked to check infinity arithmetic
