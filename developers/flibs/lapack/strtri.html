<pre class=man>STRTRI(3)                  LAPACK routine                 STRTRI(3)



<b>NAME</b>
       STRTRI - the inverse of a real upper or lower triangular matrix A

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       SUBROUTINE STRTRI( UPLO, DIAG, N, A, LDA, INFO )

           CHARACTER      DIAG, UPLO

           INTEGER        INFO, LDA, N

           REAL           A( LDA, * )

<b>PURPOSE</b>
       STRTRI  computes the inverse of a real upper or lower triangular matrix
       A.

       This is the Level 3 BLAS version of the algorithm.



<b>ARGUMENTS</b>
       UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
               = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
               = 'L':  A is lower triangular.

       DIAG    (input) CHARACTER*1
               = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
               = 'U':  A is unit triangular.

       N       (input) INTEGER
               The order of the matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

       A       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
               On entry, the triangular matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the  leading
               N-by-N  upper triangular part of the array A contains the upper
               triangular matrix, and the strictly lower triangular part of  A
               is  not  referenced.   If  UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower
               triangular part of the array A contains  the  lower  triangular
               matrix, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is not ref-
               erenced.  If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of  A  are  also
               not referenced and are assumed to be 1.  On exit, the (triangu-
               lar) inverse of the original matrix, in the same  storage  for-
               mat.

       LDA     (input) INTEGER
               The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

       INFO    (output) INTEGER
               = 0: successful exit
               &lt; 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
               &gt;  0:  if  INFO  =  i,  A(i,i) is exactly zero.  The triangular
               matrix is singular and its inverse can not be computed.
