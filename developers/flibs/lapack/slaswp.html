<pre class=man>SLASWP(3)                  LAPACK routine                 SLASWP(3)



<b>NAME</b>
       SLASWP - a series of row interchanges on the matrix A

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       SUBROUTINE SLASWP( N, A, LDA, K1, K2, IPIV, INCX )

           INTEGER        INCX, K1, K2, LDA, N

           INTEGER        IPIV( * )

           REAL           A( LDA, * )

<b>PURPOSE</b>
       SLASWP  performs a series of row interchanges on the matrix A.  One row
       interchange is initiated for each of rows K1 through K2 of A.



<b>ARGUMENTS</b>
       N       (input) INTEGER
               The number of columns of the matrix A.

       A       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
               On entry, the matrix of column dimension N  to  which  the  row
               interchanges will be applied.  On exit, the permuted matrix.

       LDA     (input) INTEGER
               The leading dimension of the array A.

       K1      (input) INTEGER
               The  first  element of IPIV for which a row interchange will be
               done.

       K2      (input) INTEGER
               The last element of IPIV for which a row  interchange  will  be
               done.

       IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (K2*abs(INCX))
               The vector of pivot indices.  Only the elements in positions K1
               through K2 of IPIV are accessed.  IPIV(K) = L  implies  rows  K
               and L are to be interchanged.

       INCX    (input) INTEGER
               The  increment  between  successive values of IPIV.  If IPIV is
               negative, the pivots are applied in reverse order.
