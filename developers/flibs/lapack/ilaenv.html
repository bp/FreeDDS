<pre class=man>ILAENV(3)                  LAPACK routine                 ILAENV(3)



<b>NAME</b>
       ILAENV  -  called  from the LAPACK routines to choose problem-dependent
       parameters for the local environment

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       INTEGER FUNCTION ILAENV( ISPEC, NAME, OPTS, N1, N2, N3, N4 )

           CHARACTER*(  * ) NAME, OPTS

           INTEGER      ISPEC, N1, N2, N3, N4

<b>PURPOSE</b>
       ILAENV is called from the LAPACK routines to  choose  problem-dependent
       parameters  for  the local environment.  See ISPEC for a description of
       the parameters.

       ILAENV returns an INTEGER
       if ILAENV &gt;= 0: ILAENV returns the value of the parameter specified  by
       ISPEC  if ILAENV &lt; 0:  if ILAENV = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal
       value.

       This version provides a set of parameters which should give  good,  but
       not  optimal, performance on many of the currently available computers.
       Users are encouraged to modify this subroutine to set the tuning param-
       eters  for  their  particular machine using the option and problem size
       information in the arguments.

       This routine will not function correctly if  it  is  converted  to  all
       lower case.  Converting it to all upper case is allowed.



<b>ARGUMENTS</b>
       ISPEC   (input) INTEGER
               Specifies  the parameter to be returned as the value of ILAENV.
               = 1: the optimal blocksize; if this value is  1,  an  unblocked
               algorithm  will  give  the  best performance.  = 2: the minimum
               block size for which the block routine should be used;  if  the
               usable block size is less than this value, an unblocked routine
               should be used.  = 3: the crossover point (in a block  routine,
               for  N  less  than  this  value, an unblocked routine should be
               used) = 4: the number  of  shifts,  used  in  the  nonsymmetric
               eigenvalue routines (DEPRECATED) = 5: the minimum column dimen-
               sion for blocking to be  used;  rectangular  blocks  must  have
               dimension  at  least  k by m, where k is given by ILAENV(2,...)
               and m by ILAENV(5,...)  = 6: the crossover point  for  the  SVD
               (when  reducing  an  m  by  n  matrix  to  bidiagonal  form, if
               max(m,n)/min(m,n) exceeds this value,  a  QR  factorization  is
               used  first  to  reduce the matrix to a triangular form.)  = 7:
               the number of processors
               = 8: the crossover point for the multishift QR method for  non-
               symmetric eigenvalue problems (DEPRECATED) = 9: maximum size of
               the subproblems at the bottom of the computation  tree  in  the
               divide-and-conquer  algorithm  (used by xGELSD and xGESDD) =10:
               ieee NaN arithmetic can be trusted not to trap
               =11: infinity arithmetic can be trusted not to trap
               12 &lt;= ISPEC &lt;= 16: xHSEQR or one of its subroutines, see IPARMQ
               for detailed explanation

       NAME    (input) CHARACTER*(*)
               The  name  of  the  calling subroutine, in either upper case or
               lower case.

       OPTS    (input) CHARACTER*(*)
               The character options to the subroutine NAME, concatenated into
               a  single  character  string.  For example, UPLO = 'U', TRANS =
               'T', and DIAG = 'N' for a triangular routine would be specified
               as OPTS = 'UTN'.

       N1      (input) INTEGER
               N2      (input) INTEGER N3      (input) INTEGER N4      (input)
               INTEGER Problem dimensions for the subroutine NAME;  these  may
               not all be required.

<b>FURTHER DETAILS</b>
       The  following  conventions have been used when calling ILAENV from the
       LAPACK routines:
       1)  OPTS is a concatenation of all of the character options to
           subroutine NAME, in the same order that they appear in the
           argument list for NAME, even if they are not used in determining
           the value of the parameter specified by ISPEC.
       2)  The problem dimensions N1, N2, N3, N4 are specified in the order
           that they appear in the argument list for NAME.  N1 is used
           first, N2 second, and so on, and unused problem dimensions are
           passed a value of -1.
       3)  The parameter value returned by ILAENV is checked for validity in
           the calling subroutine.  For example, ILAENV is used to retrieve
           the optimal blocksize for STRTRI as follows:

           NB = ILAENV( 1, 'STRTRI', UPLO // DIAG, N, -1, -1, -1 )
           IF( NB.LE.1 ) NB = MAX( 1, N )
