<pre class=man>SGETF2(3)                  LAPACK routine                 SGETF2(3)



<b>NAME</b>
       SGETF2 - an LU factorization of a general m-by-n matrix A using partial
       pivoting with row interchanges

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       SUBROUTINE SGETF2( M, N, A, LDA, IPIV, INFO )

           INTEGER        INFO, LDA, M, N

           INTEGER        IPIV( * )

           REAL           A( LDA, * )

<b>PURPOSE</b>
       SGETF2 computes an LU factorization of a general m-by-n matrix A  using
       partial pivoting with row interchanges.

       The factorization has the form
          A = P * L * U
       where P is a permutation matrix, L is lower triangular with unit diago-
       nal elements (lower trapezoidal if m &gt; n), and U  is  upper  triangular
       (upper trapezoidal if m &lt; n).

       This is the right-looking Level 2 BLAS version of the algorithm.



<b>ARGUMENTS</b>
       M       (input) INTEGER
               The number of rows of the matrix A.  M &gt;= 0.

       N       (input) INTEGER
               The number of columns of the matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

       A       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
               On  entry, the m by n matrix to be factored.  On exit, the fac-
               tors L and U from the factorization A = P*L*U; the unit  diago-
               nal elements of L are not stored.

       LDA     (input) INTEGER
               The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,M).

       IPIV    (output) INTEGER array, dimension (min(M,N))
               The  pivot indices; for 1 &lt;= i &lt;= min(M,N), row i of the matrix
               was interchanged with row IPIV(i).

       INFO    (output) INTEGER
               = 0: successful exit
               &lt; 0: if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
               &gt; 0: if INFO = k, U(k,k) is exactly zero. The factorization has
               been completed, but the factor U is exactly singular, and divi-
               sion by zero will occur if it is used  to  solve  a  system  of
               equations.
