    <h2>open - Opens data object in read or write mode</h2>
    <hr>
    <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
    <b>use DdsIO_mod</b>
    <p>
      <b>procedure open(</b><i>mode, label, alabel1, inherit</i><b>)</b>
      <dl><dd>
	  <b>character(len=*), intent(in)           :: </b><i>mode</i><br>
	  <b>character(len=*), intent(in)           :: </b><i>label</i><br>
	  <b>character(len=*), optional, intent(in) :: </b><i>alabel1</i><br>
	  <b>type(DdsObject), optional, intent(in)  :: </b><i>inherit</i><br>
      </dl>
      
      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
      <b>"open"</b> is a type-bound procedure on a data object of <b>type(DdsObject)</b>.
      This procedure opens the data object in one of three <i>modes</i>: 'r' (read),
      'w' (write), or 'pw' (parallel write).
      <br><br>
      If the file is opened for reading, then <i>mode</i> is specified as 'r', and the <i>label</i>
      (aka 'alias') to search for in the par file or command line is opened. Note that multiple dictionaries
      can be specified for one alias; every file will be accessible through this data object. <i>alabel1</i>
      (aka 'value') is used as a fallback in case <i>label</i> is absent. After this call,
      the data object's dictionary is ready for probing and the data object's file
      is ready for reading.
      <br><br>
      If the file is opened for writing, then <i>mode</i> is specified as 'w', and the <i>label</i>
      (aka 'alias') to search for in the par file or command line is opened. <i>alabel1</i> (aka 'value')
      is used as a fallback in case <i>label</i> is absent. If <i>inherit</i> is also specified, then
      history information from the inherit data object is passed to this data object to be opened, and
      all unspecified attributes are pulled from the inherit data object. Use <b>data%setAttr</b> to modify 
      any attribute in this data object from that of the <i>inherit</i> data object. After this call, this
      data object's file is ready for writing.
      <br><br>
      If the file is opened for parallel writing, then <i>mode</i> is specified as 'pw', and the other inputs
      are identical to normal writing mode. Writing is performed in parallel across MPI nodes; therefore the
      MPI module <b>MyMPI_mod</b> must be properly initialized using both <b>initMyMPI</b> and
      <b>setMyMPIComm</b> before any data object is opened for parallel writing.
      
      <h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
      <pre>
	use DdsIO_mod, only : DdsObject
	
	type(DdsObject) :: inData
	type(DdsObject) :: outData
	
	! open data in read mode
	call inData%open('r', 'in')
	
	! open data in write mode from inData
	call outData%setAttr('axes', 'z x y')
	call outData%open('w', 'out', inherit=inData)
	
	! close data
	call inData%close()
	call outData%close()
      </pre>
