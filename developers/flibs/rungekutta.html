    <p>
      These are a series of routines to simplify writing codes that require Runge-Kutta Extrapolators.<br>
      A generic API allows implementation details to be hidden and for the user to specify the extrapolator at run-time.<br>
      Currently implemented methods are 2nd order and 4th order.
