    <h2><u>Makefile Setup</u></h2>

    <p>
      Before building any DDS application you need to setup the following:

    <ol>
      <li>
        <b><u>Compiler</u></b>: Make sure your compiler is setup in your 
        path for the correct
        machine on which you are building. (Within BP this is setup for
        by you sourcing to "<b>devsetup</b>")<br/><br/></li>
      <li>
        <b><u>Environment</u></b>: Make sure your environment variables 
        are setup correctly
        <ul>
          <li><b>DDSROOT</b> - path to the root DDS directory. (Within BP
            this is setup for you by sourcing to "<b>devsetup</b>")</li>
          <li><b>DDS_DIST</b> - path to the distribution directory. (This is
            defaulted to /tstapps/global by the DDS Make structure)</li>
          <li><b>REMOTE_HOSTS</b> - list of remote machines to use when
            making on multiple platforms at the same time using the "all" or
            "allinstall" make options.  The newer application make files
            can determine at run-time (if <b>REMOTE_HOSTS</b> is <u>not</u>
            defined) the available machines to use via a couple of scripts 
            (gethosts &amp; chkhost).  (These will have to be setup for FreeDDS.)</li>
        </ul><br/></li>

      <li><b><u>Makefile</u></b>: Setup a Makefile similar to this one for 
        the programs "freq".  
        If you have any "C" routines, they can be included in the "CSrcs" 
        definition; otherwise it's just there if needed.  (F77Srcs, F90Srcs,
        C+Srcs &amp; C++Srcs are aliased to these.) The make flags
        (such as DEBUG, MP or FFT; see "make flags" for available flags)
        must have any non-blank definition to turn them on.
        (<u>NOTE:</u> by using "<code>LibName</code>" instead of "<code>Name</code>"
        a library is made instead of an application.)
        <u><b>WARNING:</b></u> Make sure you pick a name for your application
        that does not already exist in the installation or distribution.

<pre style="font-weight:bold">
Name  := freq
FSrcs := freq.F t2w.F w2t.F subs.F90
CSrcs :=

#DEBUG:=X 
MP    :=X
FFT   :=X

include ${DDSROOT}/etc/MakeVariables

include ${DDSROOT}/etc/MakeRules
</pre>

        Run "<a href="make/make/help.html">make help</a>" to get online help information on the use
        of the DDS Makefile features.  Run "<a href="make/make/variables.html">make variables</a>"
        for a list of the DDS Makefile variables that are used and modifiable (e.g.
        FSrcs).  Run "<a href="make/make/flags.html">make flags</a>" for a list of DDS Makefile 
        flags that can be used (e.g. FFT).  They only need to be defined with 
        some non-blank value.</li>
    </ol>
